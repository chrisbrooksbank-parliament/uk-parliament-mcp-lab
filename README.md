# UK Parliament AI Assistant

This project helps Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants, like Microsoft Copilot, answer questions using comprehensive official data from the UK Parliament. It acts as a bridge, allowing the AI to access up-to-date, reliable information directly from the source, covering members, bills, voting records, committees, debates, procedures, and much more.

## New development work
New development work is proceeding on this fork : https://github.com/ChrisBrooksbank/uk-parliament-mcp-lab
So its recommended to go there.
This repo is python, which does make it very eaasy to configure in AI clients.  

## 🔥 ESSENTIAL: System Prompt (Required for Best Results!)

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST use the starting system prompt when starting a new conversation. This is critical for accurate responses.

The easiest way to do this is to start all new conversations with the prompt  "Hello Parliament".

Or you can copy and past the following instead : 

```plaintext
You are a helpful assistant that answers questions using only data from UK Parliament MCP servers.

When the session begins, introduce yourself with a brief message such as:

"Hello! I’m a parliamentary data assistant. I can help answer questions using official data from the UK Parliament MCP APIs. Just ask me something, and I’ll fetch what I can — and I’ll always show you which sources I used."

When responding to user queries, you must:

Only retrieve and use data from the MCP API endpoints this server provides.

Avoid using any external sources or inferred knowledge.

After every response, append a list of all MCP API URLs used to generate the answer.

If no relevant data is available via the MCP API, state that clearly and do not attempt to fabricate a response.

Convert raw data into human-readable summaries while preserving accuracy, but always list the raw URLs used.
```

## What Can I Ask?

You can ask questions about virtually all aspects of UK Parliament data. Here are some key areas:

*   **Live Parliamentary Activity:** "What's happening in the House of Commons right now?" or "What's currently being debated in the Lords?"
*   **Members of Parliament:** "Tell me everything you know about Boris Johnson," "What are Sir Keir Starmer's registered interests?" or "Show me the voting record of member 4129"
*   **Bills & Legislation:** "Show me details of bill 425," "What amendments were proposed for bill 425?" or "What publications exist for the Environment Bill?"
*   **Voting Records:** "How did MPs vote on the climate change motion?" or "Show me Lords divisions on healthcare policy"
*   **Committees & Inquiries:** "Which committees are investigating economic issues?" or "Show me evidence submitted to the Treasury Committee"
*   **Parliamentary Procedures:** "Search Erskine May for references to Speaker's rulings" or "What are the oral question times this week?"
*   **Constituencies & Elections:** "Show me election results for Birmingham constituencies" or "List all constituencies in Scotland"
*   **Official Documents:** "Are there any statutory instruments about housing?" or "What treaties involve trade agreements?"
*   **Transparency Data:** "Show register of interests for Treasury ministers" or "What are the declared interests categories?"

## Disconnecting from parliament

Start a new chat session, or to keep context but disconnect from Parliament MCP servers prompt : "Goodbye Parliament"

## How Does It Work?

When you ask a question to an AI assistant connected to this tool, it doesn't just guess the answer. Instead, the assistant uses this project to query the official UK Parliament database and provides a response based on the data it finds.

This means the answers you get are more likely to be accurate and based on facts.

## Installation and Usage Guide

This project makes public UK Parliamentary data accessible to large language models (LLMs/AIs) using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).

It enables AI tools (e.g. Microsoft Copilot) to answer questions about UK Parliamentary data, as long as they support the MCP protocol.

> ✅ This project provides comprehensive coverage of UK Parliamentary data including members, bills, amendments, voting records, committees, debates, procedures, constituencies, and official documents.
> Additional data sources and endpoints are continuously being added.

Since AI is involved, some responses may be inaccurate. See **Prompting Tips** below to improve reliability.

### Installation & Setup

This section explains how to configure Microsoft Copilot in Visual Studio Code to query UK Parliamentary data via the MCP server.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (v9 or later recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

#### Clone and Open the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisbrooksbank-parliament/opendata-mcp-lab.git
cd opendata-mcp-lab
```

Or download manually and open the folder in VS Code.

#### Add MCP Server in Claude Desktop Application  

* Open the claude desktop application  
* Click settings   
* Click Developer tag  
* Click Edit Config  
* Edit file and save with UTF-8 encoding  
* Exit claude ( with TaskMon if needed ) and restart it  
* Open developer tab again and check it is running  
* Enter the system prompt and test its working ok  

Example claude_desktop_config.json file contents : 

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opendata-server": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "C:\\code\\opendata-mcp-lab\\OpenData.Mcp.Server\\OpenData.Mcp.Server.csproj"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```





#### Add MCP Server in VS Code

1.  Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
2.  Select **MCP: Add Server**.
3.  Choose **Command: Stdio**.
4.  Enter the following command (adjust path if needed):

```bash
dotnet run --project C:\code\opendata-mcp-lab\OpenData.Mcp.Server\OpenData.Mcp.Server.csproj
```

5.  Press **Enter**.

#### Start the Server

1.  Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` again.
2.  Select **MCP: List Servers**.
3.  Click the server you just added and choose **Start server**.

#### First Interaction

1.  Open **Copilot Chat** in VS Code.
2.  Set **Agent mode** using the dropdown in the bottom-left.
3.  Select your prefferred model e.g. Claude Sonnet 4
4.  Click **Configure Tools**, and select all tools from the newly added MCP server.
5.  (enter the system prompt and then) Try a prompt such as:

```plaintext
What is happening now in the House of Commons?
```

6.  Accept any permission request to allow the MCP call.

### Prompting Tips

#### ✅ System Prompt

Always begin your session with the **System Prompt** defined at the top of this guide. This is the most crucial step for ensuring the AI assistant stays on track, uses only the provided data, and cites its sources correctly.

#### 🔄 Clear Context

Use the `+` icon (new chat) if:
- The AI seems stuck in a loop
- You want to reset the conversation context

#### 🔗 Re-Display the API URL

While the AI is instructed to list source URLs automatically, you can ask for them again at any time. This is useful for troubleshooting or if you simply want to re-confirm the source for the last response.

You can ask : 

```plaintext
Show me the API URL you just used.
```

Example response:
> The API URL just used to retrieve information about Boris Johnson is:
> `https://members-api.parliament.uk/api/Members/Search?Name=Boris%20Johnson`

#### 🧠 Combine Data from Multiple Sources

Example:
```plaintext
Has Chelmsford been mentioned in either the Commons or Lords?
```

The AI may:
- Query both Commons and Lords Hansard
- Combine the results
- Offer more detail if requested

#### 🧾 See the Raw JSON

For debugging or to inspect the raw data structure, you can ask the assistant to show you the full JSON response from its last API call. This is particularly useful for developers who want to understand exactly what information the AI is working with before it is summarized.

Example prompt:
```plaintext
Show me the JSON returned from the last MCP call.
```
